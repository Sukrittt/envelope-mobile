 * The nav is a sibling overlay above the whole root Stack, not scoped to

 * included) so its carousel can animate between active states instead of
 * unmounting/remounting and cutting. An absolutely-positioned child of the
 * navigator's tabBar slot (which has no height) is untouchable on Android,
 * hence a plain sibling rather than that slot.
 *
 * Auth routing is declarative (Stack.Protected), not a redirect effect: the
 * root layout has to render a navigator on its very first render, and any
 * imperative router call that lands before that mount is dropped by
 * expo-router and logs "state update on a component that hasn't mounted yet".
 * Guards keep the Stack mounted the whole time and just change which screens
 * exist.
