// the user has paid.** RevenueCat's `CustomerInfo` is available here and is
// deliberately not used as the answer — it is a signal that something may
// have changed. Every purchase and restore ends by asking our backend, which
// verifies against RevenueCat server-side (Web/lib/billing/service.ts) and
// returns the access decision. Anything else is an entitlement a rooted
// device can mint for itself.
//
// Structured like src/lib/analytics.ts: a module singleton bound to the
// session through accessMode, so the identity mapping lives in one place
// instead of being repeated at every sign-in call site.
