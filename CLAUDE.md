# task tracking

Tasks tracked in Notion board "Aviary".

# tests are the norm

Every new feature gets a test; run `npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm test`
before every commit. Jest (`jest-expo` preset) + React Native Testing Library,
config in `jest.config.js`/`jest.setup.js`. Tests are co-located as `*.test.ts(x)`
next to their source, matching `Web/`'s Vitest convention. CI runs `npm test` on
every push/PR via `.github/workflows/test.yml`.

# success animation

App uses one shared success-tech animation (`src/components/shared/CheckIcon.tsx`: checkmark draw-on + haptic, swaps button label, background goes `tokens.mint`, auto-dismiss ~1100ms). Every synchronous success CTA (save/confirm button that resolves in-place) must reuse this pattern instead of a new toast/animation.

# voice and copy

The app is playful (Fredoka display font, Nunito body, `LoadingCaption.tsx`'s rotating
captions, Wrapped's persona cards), not corporate. Match that register in every string
a user reads: second person, sentence case, short.

- No em dashes in user-facing copy. They're the single most recognizable AI-generated
  tell, and a reader notices before they read a word. Split the sentence instead: two
  short sentences beat one long clause joined by a dash. Enforced by an eslint rule in
  `eslint.config.js`, so a stray em dash in a string fails `npm run lint`.
- Use contractions: "you're", "there's", "don't", "can't". Expanded forms ("you are not",
  "there is no", "you have assigned") are the second-loudest AI tell after the em dash, and
  every other screen already contracts, so a formal string sticks out. No lint rule catches
  this, so it's a review item.
- Never show raw server or exception text (`e.message`, `String(e)`) in an alert or
  inline error. "Failed to add expense: 503" gives the user nothing to act on. Write
  the message instead; match a known, already-written error case if there is one (see
  `app/(tabs)/envelopes.tsx`'s "already exists" check) and otherwise fall back to
  something generic like "Check your connection and try again."
- Reuse the app's existing typographic choices instead of improvising new ones: `·` as
  a separator (not `—` or `|`), the single `…` glyph for ellipsis (not three periods),
  and a standalone `—` only as the established placeholder glyph for a missing value
  (`EnvelopeRow.tsx`, `DatePicker.tsx`) rather than in a sentence.
